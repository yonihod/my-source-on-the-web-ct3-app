Hi!

I'm Yoni Hodeffi, and as you might have already read, I'm a designer, developer and a gamer. 

This website was made to showcase all of what I can do and plan to do. It also contains raw data and always evolving just like myself.

I got into development because computers have always fascinated me, the ability to write some short amount of lines and watch it comes to live has been nothing short than magic!

I created this website so I could showcase all this and with this process make it easier for you to connect with me.
 
 If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love hearing from you!
