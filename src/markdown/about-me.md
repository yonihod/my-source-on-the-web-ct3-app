Hi!

I'm Yoni, and as you might have already read, I'm a passionate developer, consultant, designer and a gamer. 



This website was made to showcase some of what I can do and... well, to have fun.

I got into development because computers have always fascinated me, the ability to write some short amount of lines and watch it comes to live has been nothing short than magic!

One of the many purposes of this website is to showcase some of my work and projects, and also to share some of my knowledge and experience with others.

I hope you enjoy your stay here, and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

 
 If you like what you see, head over to the [contact section](#contact) below and send me a text. I would love hearing from you!
