**Source on the web** has been a project that I have been developing for quite some time.

I didn't want my information to be displayed on statics paper in HR's offices, I wanted it to be accessible for everyone.

I constantly update it with new stuff I learn, this current iteration uses GatsbyJs (React), graphQL, TailWind CSS and Firebase as a host 

If you would like to peek around the source code it can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/yonihod/mysourceontheweb).
